What are trees, in Python, and how do they fit in with other data structures such as linked lists and graphs? In this course, instructor Ryan Mitchell discusses binary search trees (BSTs) and what you can do with them in a real-world context. Ryan shows you how to build a basic tree with just a few lines of Python. She steps through how to search and traverse a tree, as well as how to print a tree to a terminal. Ryan explains how to add nodes to your tree, delete them, and detect unbalanced trees. When you find an unbalanced tree, itâ€™s important to rebalance it. Ryan walks you through rebalancing four types of unbalanced trees. She concludes with a challenge that features smarter automated rebalancing.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing
1. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
